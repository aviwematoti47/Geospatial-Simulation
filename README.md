# Geospatial-Simulation
Objective:
You are required to build a geospatial simulation platform that models how different business
strategies compete in the Soweto subsistence retail market over one year, based on daily
updates. Using a cleaned dataset of Soweto subsistence retail stores, you will apply
reinforcement learning (RL) to simulate business competition over time. Your goal is to answer
the question:
“Which business strategy would be best in the Soweto subsistence retail market, and
why?”
